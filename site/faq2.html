<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions"><strong><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong>What is PPC?</strong></p>
<p>Pay per click service (or SEM – Search Engine Marketing in Google’s parlance) is a type of advertising strategy that directs traffic to your website from an ad that you paid a search engine or host website to post. You pay for each click that a person makes on that ad, whether it’s on the search results page or on a host website. The ad will only show on a results page for which the search was relevant to your business.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have access to the PPC Campaign that you are managing for me?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We offer total transparency and you can access and manage the SEM campaign anytime you want through the white label dashboard. You can see a summary of the targeted keywords and analyze backlinks. You can even integrate Google Analytics to further keep track of performance.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Can I get your PPC services without SEO?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes, as PPC is not SEO dependent. It does not rely on Google search algorithms. It’s an advertising campaign that takes advantage of Google’s nature as a search engine. Unlike SEO, PPC will never generate free traffic because Google is ranking you based on your ad spend and not the quality of your site. SEO is an investment in the quality of your site and not just an investment in gaining organic rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Does PPC put my ad in the top position of a Google search?</strong></p>
<p>No, and in most cases, you wouldn’t want it to be. The Google Adwords system does not just take into account the bid price when arranging the sponsored ads. The position of any ad takes into account over one hundred different factors including your quality score, volume of clicks as well as website and content relevancy enabling Google to deliver the right results to end users and empowering smaller advertisers to compete with bigger advertisers who have much higher budgets.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Can I target my client’s competitor keywords?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes. For pay per click services, you can target competitor keywords to attract searchers who are looking for the same business as your clients or have the same services. Additionally, you can use remarketing, which allows you to target an audience which has previously visited your website and are now searching specifically for your client’s competitors, if you choose.</p>
<p><strong><strong>How long does it take for the ads to appear on the SERPs?</strong></strong></p>
<p>All ads go through a review process performed by Google and can take a day. The process begins immediately up creation of the ad. However, some ads are eligible to run while the review is ongoing and therefore can appear in a matter of hours. However, according to Google, those ads but won’t be shown to anyone with SafeSearch enabled while the review is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>Is this the right package for my business? Who can benefit from SEM services?</strong></p>
<p>No, and in most cases, you wouldn’t want it to be. The Google Adwords system does not just take into account the bid price It improves the online presence on Google search for your business and increases the chances of targeting the right customers at the right time. Our Pay Per Click Advertising Services are suitable if you’re looking for immediate results and quick returns on your online marketing campaigns. We offer different PPC management packages to match the niche and needs of the business.</p>
<p><strong><strong>I already have an existing Google AdWords account. Do I still need to pay for the setup fee?</strong></strong></p>
<p>It depends. If you have Pay Per Click campaigns that are already running and only minimal changes need to be made, the setup fee is waived. If you have an account but the campaigns still need to be set up or there are a lot of settings that need to changed, then you will need to pay for the setup fee.
