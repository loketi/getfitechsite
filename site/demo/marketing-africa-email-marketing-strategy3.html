<p><strong>Campaign Objective:</strong>
Subscriber Growth:</p>
<p>So assuming you capture contacts of anyone that emails you like in my case, and add it to a mailing list for monthly sends, then the process will be as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add contacts of anyone that emails you to a list named "<strong>Prospects"</strong></li>
<li>Upload to or Sync this list with your marketing automation platform</li>
<li>Configure platform so that after 2 weeks of being added, the new contact(s) is/are started down the path of a campaign dubbed "<strong>welcome-nurture-series"</strong> which contains a series of emails as follows.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Intro / Pitch:</strong></p>
<p>The first email will introduce them to <strong>Marketing Africa</strong> magazine, share a brief history, the inspiration behind the magazine, its mission and include a soft "ask" to join other "<strong>X" number of devoted readers</strong> already loving the magazine, and a preview of past editions. This soft ask will include a CTA button that redirects to a dedicated landing page with a subscriber sign-up form.</p>
<p>The landing page will also have links to atleast 5 recent editions of the magazine, some editions to include gated content (requiring sign-up to access) and a simple lead capture form with fields for email address, phone# and name (some might prefer to sign up with personal instead of work email).</p>
<p>The landing page will be UTM tagged for email conversion tracking via Google Analytics. Users that honour the "ask" by signing-up will be added to a new list/segment named "<strong>Confirmed-Subs</strong>”, the fate of this segment is discussed further down. Those that do not click through will proceed to step 2. nurture.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Nurture</strong><br>
Recipients that don’t click through or convert will continue to receive monthly updates about the magazine with snippets of recent stories and “<strong>read more</strong>” hyperlinked to the landing page referenced in step 1. We’ll monitor engagement metrics monthly and contacts that don’t open or engage with email after 4-5 months will be removed from the “<strong>Prospects</strong>” list and put on a suppression list and any unsubscribes and hard bounces deleted from the platform.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Confirmed-Subs Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Contacts that convert at the landing page will immediately receive a welcome email and a thank you note for signing up from the CEO and be notified about what to expect i.e.</p>
<p>-&gt; Email frequency ie every 2 weeks<br>
-&gt; Publication timeline<br>
-&gt; Links to last 3 editions of the magazine<br>
-&gt; Highlights of stories in the upcoming edition</p>
<p><strong>Monetization</strong>:</p>
<p>Now, assuming your goal is to make money from hardcopy subscription, then we’ll analyze <a href="http://joom.ag" target="_blank">joom.ag</a> analytics data, pull a list of the most devoted/engaged users defined as those users that read most editions and add them to a separate list called “<strong>Goldmine-subs</strong>”.</p>
<p>This list/segment of super-subscribers will get the most attention i.e. they’ll receive updates about upcoming events, TBD (To Be Determined) benefits and above all a nudge in the monthly emails encouraging them to register for the hardcopy edition and list benefits of doing so. So a script would go along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi {{FName}},</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Screen fatigue seems to be a major issue these days, especially with our eyes glued to computers and smartphones all day at work and home, however, that shouldn’t prevent you from enjoying your favorite stories from the Marketing Africa Mag. because a hardcopy edition you can take with you anywhere might just be the perfect relief you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As such we’re offering a limited time discount to our biggest fans like you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sign-up today</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Never miss a story whenever a new issue comes out of print because we’ll mail you a copy the first week of the month. Our print edition uses recycled paper and environmentally friendly printing process without compromising quality etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>{{Signature}}*</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>List Management</strong></p>
<p>Every month we’ll analyze engagement metrics to see how your existing database is performing, scrub it to remove dead contacts/emails that hard bounce, unsubscribes, and set-up a reactivation campaign to try and revive valid contacts that have not engaged with your content in the past 3-5 months.</p>
<p><strong>Mock-up template</strong></p>
<p>I’ve put a spin on one of your monthly emails I received :). See it below, images were pulled from your website.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://getfitech.com/demo/marketing-africa/monthly-email-demo.html" target="_blank">FOLLOW THIS LINK TO VIEW THE MOCK-UP TEMPLATE</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>So, why work with us?</strong></p>
<p>I have no doubt that you can easily do this in-house since Joomag already has an email marketing module baked into it accessible via the <a href="https://www.joomag.com/en/pricing" target="_blank">Scale Plan</a>, but do you have the time? and what about the cost saving?</p>
<p>Joomag plan that incorporates <a href="https://www.joomag.com/en/email-marketing" target="_blank">email marketing</a> and audience analytics costs a whopping USD$400/month, billed annually for the software only, ref <a href="https://www.joomag.com/en/pricing" target="_blank">https://www.joomag.com/en/pricing</a>, add the cost of a full time hire to manage it and the cost easily goes through the roof!</p>
<p>So in case you opt to outsource then I can assure you that by working with us you get all the benefits of email marketing minus the cost of a full time hire and we’ll manage all the sends from either our platform customized for your company complete with branding and domain or Joomag; you just need to give us access to the latter and we’ll handle the rest in collaboration with your team, core tasks being as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>List Management</strong>: Routine scrubbing of your email database to remove dead/inactive contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Re-engagement</strong>: Proposing reactivation/re-engagement campaigns to win back unengaged contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Email Campaigns</strong>: Copywriting, Coding templates, end-to-end implementation of pre-scheduled marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Conversion tracking and reporting on campaign performance.</li>
<li><strong>ECO</strong>: Suggesting and implementing email conversion optimization ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this function is being handled internally and you prefer to keep it that way then I understand. Otherwise happy to hear your thoughts.</p>
